# Project Brief: Cakemail SMTP Gateway

## Executive Summary

**Cakemail SMTP Gateway** is a high-performance SMTP server that bridges the SMTP protocol to the Cakemail Email API, enabling developers to send emails through Cakemail's infrastructure using standard SMTP libraries and legacy applications. The gateway addresses the critical need for seamless migration from traditional SMTP-based email services (SendGrid, Mandrill, Mailgun, AWS SES) to Cakemail's modern API platform without requiring application code changes. Target users include developers with existing SMTP integrations and organizations operating legacy systems that cannot easily adopt REST APIs. The gateway delivers enterprise-grade throughput (1M+ emails/hour) while maintaining drop-in compatibility with existing SMTP workflows, significantly reducing migration friction and accelerating Cakemail adoption.

## Problem Statement

Many developers and organizations rely on SMTP-based email delivery services like SendGrid, Mandrill, Mailgun, and AWS SES. When considering migration to Cakemail's Email API, they face significant technical barriers:

**Current State & Pain Points:**
- Existing applications are built around SMTP protocol integration using standard libraries
- Legacy systems cannot easily be refactored to adopt REST API calls
- Migration requires substantial code changes, testing, and deployment across multiple services
- Development teams face opportunity cost: migration work delays feature development
- Risk of introducing bugs during email infrastructure replacement

**Impact:**
- **Migration friction** creates a significant barrier to Cakemail adoption, even when the Email API offers superior features or pricing
- **Lost revenue opportunities** as potential customers choose to stay with incumbent providers due to switching costs
- **Competitive disadvantage** against providers offering SMTP compatibility alongside modern APIs
- **Developer time waste**: Teams estimate weeks or months of effort for what should be a configuration change

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Cakemail's Email API requires REST integration, which is not backward-compatible with SMTP
- Manual SMTP-to-API rewrite forces customers to modify and retest application code
- No "drop-in replacement" option exists for customers wanting zero-downtime migration

**Urgency:**
- Email infrastructure is mission-critical; customers are reluctant to risk disruption
- Competitors offering SMTP compatibility have a clear adoption advantage
- Market window exists to capture migrating customers from other SMTP providers

## Proposed Solution

The **Cakemail SMTP Gateway** is a standalone SMTP server that acts as a protocol translation layer between SMTP clients and the Cakemail Email API.

**Core Concept:**
- Accept standard SMTP connections (port 587/TLS) from any SMTP-compatible client
- Authenticate users via username/password credentials that map to Cakemail account credentials
- Parse incoming SMTP email messages (headers, body, attachments)
- Transform SMTP data into Cakemail Email API requests
- Forward emails to Cakemail's infrastructure via HTTPS API calls
- Return SMTP success/error responses to the client

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Zero code changes required**: Drop-in replacement for SendGrid/Mandrill/Mailgun SMTP endpoints - simply update the SMTP hostname and credentials
- **Enterprise-grade performance**: Designed to handle 1M+ emails per hour through async processing, connection pooling, and horizontal scaling
- **Full SMTP compliance**: Supports standard SMTP features (TLS, AUTH, MIME, attachments) ensuring compatibility with all major libraries and clients
- **Kubernetes-native**: Designed for cloud deployment with auto-scaling, health checks, and observability

**Why This Succeeds:**
- **Eliminates migration friction**: What previously required weeks of development becomes a 5-minute configuration change
- **Preserves developer workflows**: Teams continue using familiar SMTP libraries and patterns
- **Enables gradual transition**: Customers can migrate to SMTP first, then optionally adopt the REST API later for advanced features
- **Competitive parity**: Matches capabilities of competitors while leveraging Cakemail's superior email infrastructure

**High-Level Vision:**
A production-ready, enterprise-grade SMTP gateway that becomes the standard migration path for customers moving to Cakemail from legacy SMTP providers, accelerating platform adoption and reducing customer acquisition friction. As a **Canadian-owned solution**, the gateway provides a competitive alternative to US-based SMTP providers, enabling both transactional and high-volume marketing email delivery at enterprise scale.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Cakemail API capacity**: If Cakemail Email API cannot handle 1M+ emails/hour or becomes a bottleneck, gateway performance degrades. *Mitigation: Load test API early, work with API team on capacity planning*
- **Authentication endpoint dependency**: If no Cakemail API endpoint exists to validate SMTP credentials, requires API changes before gateway can launch. *Mitigation: Validate authentication mechanism feasibility in discovery phase*
- **Python performance ceiling**: Python async may struggle to achieve 99.99% uptime under high load or memory pressure. *Mitigation: Conduct performance benchmarking early, consider fallback to Go if targets unachievable*
- **OVH infrastructure reliability**: OVH Private Cloud may not provide 99.99% uptime guarantees. *Mitigation: Review OVH SLA, architect for multi-zone redundancy, prepare failover plans*
- **Market validation failure**: Canadian market demand for SMTP gateway may be overestimated. *Mitigation: Pre-launch survey with existing customers, beta program with 10+ pilot users*
- **Feature gap vs competitors**: Basic SMTP implementation may lack features customers expect (DKIM, webhooks, dashboard). *Mitigation: Conduct competitor feature analysis, prioritize most-requested features for Phase 2*
- **Security vulnerabilities**: SMTP protocol and credential handling introduce attack surface (spam relay, credential theft). *Mitigation: Security audit before launch, rate limiting, connection throttling*

### Open Questions

- Does Cakemail Email API have an authentication endpoint to validate SMTP credentials and retrieve API keys?
- What is the current capacity limit of the Cakemail Email API (requests/second, emails/hour)?
- Are there existing Cakemail customers requesting SMTP support? If so, what are their primary use cases?
